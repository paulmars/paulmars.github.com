title: Shell Gamification.
---

Today I gamified my shell.

Ok, stop laughing, I only spent 2 hours working on it.

Basically I wanted to actually learn the aliases I've carefully setup in my shell. I tend to think up some good ones, especially with regard to git and then I never use them.

So, first things first, I wanted my shell to tell me everytime I typed a command that had an alias already set for it. That worked out great. It stays out of my way and just passively tells me every time I do something less than optimal.

Then I went a step further. I assigned a points system to short commands and longs commands. Everytime I write a short command I get another point. Everytime I type in a command when I should have used an alias, it removed 50 points.

It also keeps my highscore, the last command I typed and the last command I got wrong.
