Recently my cofounder had drinks with someone who works at apple in marketing. All credit belongs to them.

Designing an app icon? Want to have a memorable brand? Drag your app in to a folder with 3 other apps. Does you app icon still stand out? If no, redo the icon.

Try this test with Path, Threes, or 4sq. You will realize that each has an extremely simple and memorable icon.

# Designers already know this

They are already testing their designs under the worst case scenarios. Facebook blogged that they didn't do a new newsfeed because they have users with small screens and no contrast. Artists and Photographers will often flip their painting upside down in order to see the shapes and reset their brain

Back up from your work, and you'll do better work.
