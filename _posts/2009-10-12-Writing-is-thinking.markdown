That is about it. &nbsp;Explaining something forces you to understand it. &nbsp;Things sound 10x worse when you try and convince someone else about them. &nbsp;I've found the same thing about writing execsums, selling, pitching, lecturing.

It is hard but worth it. &nbsp;You'll force yourself to level up, because that is the only way you will be able to do what you need to get by.
