This blog is written in Sinatra, it is like Rails but without a ton of stuff I'm used to.  I'm forced to work without migrations, view helpers, form builders.  The good stuff.

But every time I hear myself complaining, I hear the way people have talked about Java to me.  Connection Pools, JVM, massive scaling, byte code, and other crud that has been in java forever but only recently got in to rails.

Is every successive generation of technology a re-implementation of the smallest cell of useful functionality?  Is sinatra growing towards rails, rails growing towards java, java towards oblivion.
