title: "ctrl caps lock"

I don't learn or relearn unless I'm forced to. Today I'm forcing myself to relearn my control key. I've turned it off completely. It does nothing.

Hopefully, in a couple weeks I'll be completely reliant on the Caps Lock key, as a replacement. I've had it mapped for years, but never trained myself to use it.
